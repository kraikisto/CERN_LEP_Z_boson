.csv files are the datafiles

.png files are pictures for the notebooks

91_with_luminosity.ipynb contains the plotting/fitting for data from 1991, where we plot number of events of each ECM value, normalised by luminosity.

91_with_luminosity_alt.ipynb uses luminosity values from a different source (which in this case actually do better).

fulldata_no_lum.ipynb has data from all four years using the invariant mass method. The previous only use data from 1991 since I don't have luminosity values for the other years.

complexities.ipynb analyses time complexies and space complexities with some basic examples and explanations.

cosmic_rays.ipynb plots the phi values to check for consmic rays (needs physics explanation).

Spin.ipynb plots cross-section as a functioin of cos(theta) to find out the spin of the particle (needs physics explanation).
