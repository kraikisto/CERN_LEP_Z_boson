# CERN_LEP_Z_boson

.csv files are the datafiles

.png files are pictures for the notebooks

fulldata_invariant_mass.ipynb has data from all four years and we find Z boson using the invariant mass method.

91_line_width_fit.ipynb contains the plotting/fitting for data from 1991, where we find Z boson by plotting number of events of each ECM value, normalised by luminosity (aka line width fit) .

91_line_width_fit_alt.ipynb uses luminosity values from a different source (which in this case actually do better).

complexities.ipynb analyses time complexies and space complexities with some basic examples and explanations.

cosmic_rays.ipynb plots the phi values to check for consmic rays (needs physics explanation).

Spin.ipynb plots cross-section as a functioin of cos(theta) to find out the spin of the particle (needs physics explanation).

pandas_speed.ipynb explains why and when pandas is faster than normal loops and shows by how much in graphs of runtime measurements
