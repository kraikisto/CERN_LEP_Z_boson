# CERN_LEP_Z_boson

.csv files are the datafiles

91_with_luminosity contains the plotting/fitting for data from 1991 with luminosity taken into account (hopefully correctly)

91_with_luminosity_alt uses different luminosity values

fulldata_no_lum has data from all four years but does not take account luminosity (because luminosity values are only available for 1991)
