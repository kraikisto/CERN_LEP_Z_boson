# CERN_LEP_Z_boson

.csv files are the datafiles

91_with_luminosity.ipynb contains the plotting/fitting for data from 1991, where we plot number of events of each ECM value, normalised by luminosity (hopefully correctly)

91_with_luminosity_alt.ipynb uses different luminosity values (which in this case actually do better)

fulldata_no_lum.ipynb has data from all four years using the invariant mass method. The previous only use data from 1991 since I dont have luminosity values for the other years
