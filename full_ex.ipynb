    "Welcome to an exercise where we will trying to determine the mass of the Z boson using data from the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP). In fact, the measurements of the Z and the W bosons' masses are the most important research done at LEP. The main problem with this the Z boson is the actual detection. Since Z bosons lifetime is very short it will decay into other particles, before we can detect it. One of the possible products of the decay can be 2 muons, which we can detect and will focus on. Here we will only use data of these double muons that come from Z particles. From the muons we can work backwards and calculate the mass of the particle that they decayed from. The mass values will vary quite a bit, but we have some methods that we can use to take out bad datapoints. \n",

The before mentioned problems in the data have been fixed already, but the negative values still need to be removed. Add a condition to remove them.

    "Is pandas really faster? Well the answer is most of the time. A bunch of the more advanced python librabries like numpy and pandas use vectorisation the speed up their functions. In vectorisation, instead of running through the values one by one, we perform the same operation on a bunch of values saved as a vector. This is possible because of modern CPUs single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) processing. Traditionally processors could only hold one value and thus had to process one value at a time. Modern processors can hold multiple values and therefore run the same operation on a vector of values if you program it to do so. Let's now demonstrate this is a simple example comparing a columns of random data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a simple example and compare the values from 2 columns in three different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "`df[fd.A != df.B]`  pandas using vectorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "`df[[x != y for x, y in zip(df.A, df.B)]]` Using list comprehension, which is essentially a built-in optimised for-loop\n",

    "\n",
    "We have plotted the measurements in logarithmic scale, but if you were to show them in linear scale, the lines would in fact be straight. A loop over a dataset does in fact always grow linearly in runtime and vectorisation doesn't change that, but it does significantly affect the slope of the graph. You can also notice that the basic for-loop is actually faster for small datasets, showing that you can't test functions just with small datasets and assume they behave the same way with bigger ones. Interestingly if we compare to another vectorised method from numpy we see that it is even faster. It seems that specifically `.values` is signifantly better than its pandas counterpart:\n",

    "Here it's clear that the slope of the graph is the same and rather the initial runtime is changed. Vectorisation isn't always even better. One example of this is flattening lists, meaning turning a list with multiple dimensions into a 1-dimensional list. This is most common with turning a matrix into a list.

Since the Hamiltionian gives us the energy of the system, let's look at that. We can assume that there are no outside forces that would affect the Z boson, therefore it keeps a constant energy $M_0$, until decaying. Therefore we get:\n",

Let's now look at something called line width fit: Here we will plot ECM values instead of invariant mass values. Therefore we get a histogram that shows how many datapoints (meaning particles) we produce at each ECM values. Since LEP only produces Z bosons, the amount of Z bosons goes up as we get closer to its invariant mass and we should be able to measure it very accurately.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are now relying on the number particles produced as a metric, the performace of the accelerator is also a variable. The performance of the accelerator can vary significantly and CERN measures it using a physical quantity called luminosity. Luminosity has a formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma} \\dfrac{dN}{dt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning it is the rate of events divided by cross-section. Cross-section describes the probability of the colliding particles actually causing a reaction. Therefore integraded luminosity is just the total number of events divided by the cross-section. The cross-section values are what we actually want to find and they can be calculated by dividing the number of events by the integrated luminosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use integrated luminosity over the time that the accelerator run at a specific ECM. Since each center-of-mass energy (ECM) value has a different luminosity we need to find all ECM values and that can be done by using `.ECM.unique()` function on the dataset. From that we can see some values that are quite close to each other. This is because of noise in the measurement and can be fixed by setting the luminosity to all the ECM values less than 0.1 away from the exact value. Doing that we find that there are 7 different sections for ECM. Using the table given we can assign a luminosity to each datapoint in the dataset using `.loc`. The actual values for integrated luminosity can be found on papers published by CERN. An explanation on how the luminosity is measured can be found below.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the number electrons and positrons in the accelerator, $f$ the frequency which they go around the the accelerator and $A$ the area of the beam. These quantities can be hard to measure accurately, so the result from this isn't the most accurate one we can get. Instead we use something called Bhabha scattering. It's a process where the colliding electron and positron produce a photon, which decays into an electron and a positron. For this process, the theoretical cross-section is known very accurately. Therefore we can measure the amount of events for this process in the accelerator and use the first formula to determine the luminosity. This gives us the luminosity for the accelerator. \n",

    "This isn't the most efficient method of testing the speed of an algorithm, since it just takes the real times and subtracts them. It does work for basic testing and is much easier to use than the one used previously to test vectorisation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "So for the smaller dataset the first one is slower, but for the larger its always faster, why is this? Well lets look at the programs starting with the lines: \n",
    "    \n",
    "`condition1 = np.abs(dataset.ECM-88.5) < 0.1` program one\n",
    "\n",
    "`index1 = dataset[dataset.ECM == 89.478].index[0]` program two\n",
    "    \n",
    "Both are actually quite similar, running through the entire data checking the codition for each value. Let's say we have $N$ number of datapoints in our data. Then going through would take $aN$ time where $a$ is the amount of time it takes to go through one and is a constant. We usually denote this as $O(N)$ time complexity.  \n",

    "`dataset.loc[:index1, \"LUM\"] = 711.1` program two\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here program one is actually worse. It goes through the entire data checking the whether the condition is True or False just like the last lines we looked at. This is slower than actually giving the indices that need to be edited. Since program 2 goes through all datapoints once, instead of 7 times its 7 times faster. Both programs are still $O(N)$ complexity since both runtimes grow linearly in terms of $N$, one is just always 7 times slower. \n",
    "\n",
    "But now the reason why program 2 is worse on a large dataset: It has to sort the data first. There are a bunch of different sorting algorithms, but this uses quicksort as a default which is $O(N log N)$. This is larger than any of the other parts of the program so when the amount of data grows this will grow faster than all the other parts explaining why for a larger dataset the second program is always slower. \n",
    "\n",

Electron-positron colliders are simply better at some tasks, which is why CERN is actually planning on making a new electron-positron collider (FCC).\n",

Its infinite when the particle goes to the direction of the beam pipe and zero if the particle goes directly at the wall of the beam pipe. Going perpendicular to the wall means the particle will have less distance to go through. When the particle is going through, it scatters randomly, affecting its trajectory which causes inaccuracies in the measurement. "
